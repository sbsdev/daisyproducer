`Daisy Producer`_ is a system to help you manage the production
process of accessible media. It assumes that you are transforming the
content from hard copy or any electronic format to `DTBook XML`_. Once
you have the DTBook XML the `Daisy Pipeline`_ and liblouis_ can be
used to generate Daisy Talking Books, Large Print and Braille in a
fully automated way.
