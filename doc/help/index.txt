 Daisy Producer Manual
=======================

`Daisy Producer`_ is a system to help you manage the production
process of accessible media. It assumes that you are transforming the
content from hard copy or any electronic format to `DTBook XML`_. Once
you have the DTBook XML the `Daisy Pipeline`_ and liblouis_ can be
used to generate Daisy Talking Books, Large Print and Braille in a
fully automated way.

Daisy producer mainly tracks the status of the transformation process
and helps you manage your artifacts that are needed in the
transformation process.

For the generation of accessible media Daisy Producer offers a nice
interface however the work is essentially done by the Daisy Pipeline
and liblouis.

Daisy Producer in 3 steps
=========================

1. Create a new document

   a) Click on `Create a new document`_ in the `Manage tab`_ and  fill in the form
   b) click on `Create`

.. _Manage tab: ../manage/
.. _Create a new document: ../manage/create/

2. Work on a document 

   a) Click on the `TODO tab`_ and click on the title of the
      document you intend to work on.

   b) The detailed view lets you upload attachments. You could upload
      the PDF that you received from the source publisher or a RTF
      that resulted from the OCR process for example.
      
      i) Add a comment relating to this attachment in the comment field
      ii) Add a file in the file chooser field
      iii) Click on `Add`

   c) The detailed view also lets you upload versions. Versions
      contain the DTBook XML of your document. As you transform the
      document into DTBook XML (using the initial version as a bases)
      you will be uploading versions of this XML. The first one maybe
      contains a preliminary draft, the second one will have
      corrections from a proof reader, etc.

      i) Add a comment relating to this version in the comment field
      ii) Add a file in the file chooser field
      iii) Click on `Add`

   d) As you continue to work on the document you will reflect the
      state of your work by transitioning the state of the document to
      the corresponding state. Depending on your role you will only
      see documents that are in a certain state.

      i) Pick the next state in the state dropdown
      ii) Click on `Transition`

.. _TODO tab: ../todo

3. Get an accessible version of the document

   a) Once the document is in state `approved` it will show up in the
      `Browse tab`_. Click on the title of the document you intend to
      get an accessible version of.

   b) Specify how you want your accessible version (in the case of
      Large Print specify `Font`, `Font size`, etc for example).

   c) Click on `Download`

.. _Browse tab: ../


Tutorial
========

Creating a new document
-----------------------

Start by creating a new document. To do this select the under the
`Manage tab`_ and click on `Create a new document`_. The form will let
you enter all the relevant meta data. After successful creation of the
document you will see it in the `management overview`_.

.. _management overview: ../manage/

Working on a document
---------------------

Now you can go into the `TODO tab`_ and look at the list of documents
that need to be worked on. Your newly created document is listed by
its title. Click on the title to get a detailed overview for this
document. The detailed overview shows you all the meta data (such as
author and title of the document) and it lets you add attachments and
versions to this document. An attachment is typically added if you
have a PDF as the result of a scanning process. As you then progress
transforming the document into DTBook XML you can upload new versions
of the XML until you are finished. Mark the state of the document as
you proceed. Dependent on your group membership you will only see
documents of a certain state for which you are responsible.

Consuming a document
--------------------

Once the document has reached the state `approved` it will be listed
in the `Browse tab`_. Again clicking on a document title will show a
detailed overview of a document and list the options for download. A
document can be fetched as a either 

Large Print
	with options such as `Font`, `Font size`, `Alignment`, etc.

Braille 
	with options such as `Contraction`, `Hyphenation`, etc.

Use Cases
=========

There are a number of use cases that Daisy Producer tries to cover.

- Firstly there are the users that want to consume an accessible
  document
- Secondly there are the users who are working on making a document
  accessible, i.e. transforming the content into a markup that is
  understood by the backends.
- And thirdly there are the users who oversee the production process,
  edit the meta data of a document and initiate the production of a
  new document.

In some cases these users are one and the same person in other cases
they might be different people.

Consume accessible documents
----------------------------

Download a customized braille for a document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Carol would like to read a certain book in braille. She goes to the
web site and searches for "Wachtmeister Studer". She finds the title
and goes to the detailed overview for this title. In there she
specifies how she would like to have her Braille and downloads a
customized version of "Wachtmeister Studer" in braille.

Download a customized large print for a document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Carol would like to read a certain book in large print. She goes to
the web site and searches for "Wachtmeister Studer". She finds the
title and goes to the detailed overview for this title. In there she
specifies how she would like to have her large print and downloads a
customized version of "Wachtmeister Studer" in large print.

Create documents and edit meta data
-----------------------------------

Create a Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Manager Alice wants to initiate the work on a book say, "Wachtmeister
Studer" by Friedrich Glauser. For that reason she creates a new
document which serves as a container for the given meta data (most
likely something along the lines of MarcXML_ or `MARC 21`_).

.. _MarcXML: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MARCXML
.. _MARC 21: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MARC21

Modify the meta data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bob discovered that the publishing date in the meta data of
"Wachtmeister Studer" is wrong. He notifies manager Alice and she
corrects the date in the meta data of "Wachtmeister Studer".

Manage documents
----------------

Add an attachment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dave is tasked to work on the document "Wachtmeister Studer". It will
show up in his list of pending tasks. He does the necessary work to
complete the task, e.g. scan or ocr the document and attaches the
result to the document. Finally he indicates that he is done with his
work which will move the workflow state to the next state.

Update the document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Eve is tasked to transform the document into valid XML. She uses
previous results of work done on and attached to the document, e.g. a
ocred version of the document as rtf or maybe a pdf as received from
the publisher. She enhances the initial XML (that was created from the
meta data) to contain the information from the respective attachment.
Finally she indicates that she is done with her work which will move
the workflow state to the next state.
